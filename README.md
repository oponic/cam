# Platforms
#### Windows
I'm planning for a Windows release, but less often.
Around 13% of our code may be more unix-related but we hope to bridge the gap.
#### Solaris & derivatives
One day. Shouldn't be too hard.
#### BSD
Like the Windows release, not as often. Maybe every 2 stable releases.
But we do hope for it.
#### macOS
macOS being a BSD, it assumes the same terms. Just recompiled for Darwin.
#### Linux
Everything.
#### JVM (cross-platform)
Planned for the Solaris & Illumos version in case tools like nodeJS aren't available.
May be a faster option for the BSD options too.
One day.
# Compilation
code doesn't exist yet you freaks
but we'll have a build script (batch and shell)
